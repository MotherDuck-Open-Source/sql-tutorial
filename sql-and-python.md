# 3. Combining SQL and Python

1. Why is DuckDB awesome?
If SQL is the right tool for the job, you can do it, if Ibis/Pandas/etc is the right tool for the job, you can do it too!

2. Flavors:
- All SQL
- Mix and match SQL + DataFrames
- All DataFrames

3. Use DuckDB as the engine, all with DataFrame syntax
- Pandas, Apache Arrow, Numpy, Polars
- Ibis
- PySpark API
- DuckDB Relational API
