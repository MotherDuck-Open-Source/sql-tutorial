    "Today, we'll cover some basic operations in DuckDB SQL. DuckDB is a high-performance analytical database system designed for easy integration with data science workflows. It is particularly well-suited for in-memory processing and can handle complex queries efficiently. Learning SQL is a great skill because it allows you to manage and analyze large datasets quickly and effectively.\n",
